You are developing the service layer of an application like Instagram. You are working
on a module which is responsible for supporting image upload and storage in the
Cloud. Along with the image, its metadata must be persisted in a NoSQL storage.
Multiple users are going to use this service at the same time. For this reason, the
service should be scalable.

The team currently uses API Gateway, Lambda Functions, S3 and DynamoDB services.

Language: Python3.7+

    1. Uploading image with metadata

2. Write unit tests to cover all scenarios
3. API documentation and usage instructions
